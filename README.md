DECODING BREAST CANCER HISTOPATHALOGY
This project focuses on classifying histopathology images as either benign or malignant. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the project involves training the model on labeled images, optimizing its performance, and evaluating its accuracy in distinguishing between these two categories. The primary goal is to leverage deep learning techniques to enhance the classification of benign and malignant histopathology images.
